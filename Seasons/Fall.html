  <h1>There are soooooo many Fall activities!</h1>

  <p><img src="fall.jpg" alt="Fall" class="yesbird" title="Fall vibe">
  There are like so many things to do in the Fall. Some examples are you can go to the pumpkin patch. At the pumpkin patch you can look at all the cute couples taking pictures and remind yourself that you will be lonely for the rest of your sad, pitful, and nonmeaningful life. Another exciting Fall activity that you could participate in while in Helena is attend a sporting event. You could go to a Carroll mens soccer game or if you want to see some real entertainment Carroll college football team plays as well. Another Helena Fall activity you can attend is to go to your local Starbucks. There you can watch the flood of white girls going to get there pumpkin spice latte. So much fun!!! Oh, I forgot you can also hike around here but, you gotta be quick and make sure you beat the on coming winter that could come at any second. You better enjoy your Fall when you can in Montana because sometimes you don't even get it. Finally, I think I speak for everyone who drinks in college Halloween week is pretty kick ass. Be prepared though you may need multiple costumes. This may be my favotie Fall activity even over my birthday. Yes I am a libra!</p>
