  Where do I even start? Spring has so much to offer! There are loads of activites to participate in and the weather is starting to get better as well. Yet like Fall, in Helena you better check the weather because it could be sunny and 70 and then snowing in an instant. Some spring activites that everyone enjoys and participates include softball weekend. Softball weekend is a fun even that Carroll College puts on. It is just all around good, clean, fun for everyone!. Another spring event is outdoor track! Oooo! Aaaa! You can watch Carroll College track team participate at their tack which is just the middle school down the road. More fun things to do in Helena would inlcude celebrating Easter. Helena hosts a catholic Cathedral which is rumored to host a kick ass easter mass. Oh and how can I forget?! Spring break is also during the spring! I would reccomend heading down to Florida and doing stuff we all know you will regret but never forget! WoooHoooo!</p>
