      <p><img src="game.jpeg" alt="Games" class="chuck" title="Games"> Lets get one thing straight. The oppion of happiesnss. is strictly based on perspective. lets say I find humor in something, that maybe you have already seen humor in. yea I was a little late to the game but I still enjoyed it. I think we all know what im talking about. And its my use of instagram rees=ls. Lets get another thing stright. im not doin this for attention or becuase im a person who is stuck to their ways. I jsut find this the better platform. It shows me how I want to watch my memes and my reels videos. If anything you guys should be glad that i have reels becuae you could send tictoks and you could be the funniest person in your friend group. So why dont all yo ticktok users just go and stop being turds. You mother reppen proud sons. #longlivereels.</p>
