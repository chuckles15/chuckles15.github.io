      <h1>I do a lot of things but here are a few below. </h1>

      <p><img src="skiing.jpeg" alt="Skiing" class="chuck" title="Skiing"> I do many, many, many activities. Some require a lot of effort mentally. Others are more physical, if your pickin up what im putting down. We must stay focused on the matter at hand. I am the best dancer at a college party, you will ever see. Im no hip hop dancer professional, you will not see me doing flips or jumps, or spins even. But you will see the heart of a lion and the drive of an ox when I get onto that dance floor and make sweet sweet love to it. Cuz im down, to get down. I hope this just shows yo how passionate I am about dancing. Oh hey, I also like to ski. Ive been skiing for a while. It was a great family bonding expierence. I think im the best skiier in my family, I think the others are trash. they just cant keep up with me. Oh hey, did I tell ya I like to hike.</p>
