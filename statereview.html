  <h1> Review of State Websites</h1>

  <li> <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov/"> Nebraska</a> </li>
  <p> Right off the bat the Nebraska page looks clean, very simple, and organized. I like the search bar right smack dab in the middle because to me it seems like that means they are here to help me. I am also a fan of the stats that they have below. I especially enjoy the way they display those stats. Some things that I am not to keen on is the second search bar in the corner, I mean isnt one enough? I also do not like there top drop down menu I would rather be show just the column that I selected not the others as well. The one thing though that stands out amongst all is the short pages. I love that! Everywhere you go there are short pages. My favorite page and first site goes to Nebraska. I love the short pages and I really like the stats they have listed. The flaws I did find were minor enough that it did't destroy my likness for the website.

  <li><a href="https://delaware.gov/"> Delaware</a></li>
  <p> As soon as the page is loaded I feel a sense of class, cleanliness, organization. The logo really sets the tone, the cursive D. Other than that I like the organization of the home page and the search bar that is smack dab in the front ready to help. I am also a fan that they have more than links and text content. They also have videos! The first page is a little to long for my liking. Otherwise this is a really good looking page that is simple and clean. Second place is going to Delaware because of its homepage being a little to long for my liking. The length of the pages are very important to me.

  <li><a href="https://www.myflorida.com/">Florida</a> </li>
  <p> Right away I notice that this is not a .gov page. That probably needs to change because it might confuse people like me looking for an official page. I didn't know I would say this but the page is to short and to simple. There is not really a menu and the home page is just a search bar. I love the search bars but I feel like I don't even know what to search. This site is to barron. I like the picture and colors though. Third place goes to florida. They took my favorite things search bar in the middle and short homepage but just over did it.

  <li><a href="https://www.illinois.gov/">Illinois </a></li>
  <p> I am not a fan of the virtual assistant. Seeing the virtual assistant has kinda ruined the page for me. I have not had good expeirences with them. I like the home page it is short and not to filled with information. The site is also shrinkable to any size witch is a plus. I don't really have any complaints about this page but I feel like it is lacking something. Maybe this page needs more pzzaazzz! The Illinois page is my 4th place because of that stinking virtual assistant. It's just not my cup of tea.
  </p>

  <li> <a href= "https://www.alaska.gov"> Alaska </a> </li>
  <p> I like the state of Alaska but I am not going to let that bias affect my rating. Some things that I noticed with the Alaska page was it seemed kind of outdated and old. I was also not a fan of its color scheme as well. The page is also not very useful when changeing the display size. My Final con with it is that some of information text size is to small. I do like the length of the homepage and picture background it has. The Alaska page is ultimatley my least favorite cite because of how old it feels.
