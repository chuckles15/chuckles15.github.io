<h1>2 Good Websites</h1>

  <ol>

  <li> <a href="https://www.zillow.com/"> Zillow</a> </li>
  <p>Wow!!! Zillow what a sleek and simple website that gets the job done. The most important aspect that makes this a great and spectacular page is that it is simple to find homes in your area. I mean, front and center of the page is a toolbar to out in your desired location. How great is that! Besides it being a very easy to navigate website with a proper header menu and search toolbar, it is goodlooking as well. Zillows hompage is short, simple, and not full of distractions. It keeps to a color code which adds to the appeal and it doesnt over use it. The page maintains the same blue all the way through. Regarding the code it is very organized. The code for the homepage is very long but even for a novice like me I can tell the order of everything and what a lot of the code links to. The website is very easy to navigate as well with its menu bar at the top and not to many options. Overall I think the Zillow homepage is a great example of a well put togehter and good looking website. It has everything that I look for in a website well done Zillow. If I had to rate the Zillow webpage out of 10 I would give it a 9 out of 10. Huzzah!!!

  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/"> Youtube</a></li>
  <p> After examining the Youtube website there are many things I like about it! One of the aspects I really like about this website is the continous videos that load as you scroll down. It seems like an endless amount of content that you can explore through. Another aspect that I enjoy when visiting this website is the many forms to search through its content. There are menus and toolbars that can help you be as general or as precise as you want when looking for the videos you desire. Layout wise I think that they are it is a fitting design based on the amount of content they have. They designate areas to search and navigate the website on the top and on the side which I think is appropriate for the amount of content they have. There isn't to much design besides layout. You get a majority of you color from the videos that pop-up so its fitting to stick with mainly black and white background and text. I have found this website to be very user friendly as well from both the perspective of a consumer and creator. The steps to create and the tools to consumer are simple. The code for the website is sort of complicated primarily because of the enormous amount of content on the page. I can track the code through the website alright but it may be a little more advanced for my pay grade. All together I think this is a really well put together website even with the loads of content and services it provides. I would score this page a 7.9 out of 10. Good job Youtube!

  <h1>1 Bad Website</h1>

  <ol>

<li><a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/"> Yale Art School</a></li>
<p>For being the Yale Art School webpage this a real eyesore. Not only are the blocks with the information not organized there is no color code. It is hard for me to express how hard it is to look at this page because of how unorganized and disttracting the page is. The page on a basic level isn't hard to get around. It's just the many distractions such as the background images that get me all confused and make it very disttracting. When looking at the code for the home page it is rather simple and short. The code is very easy to sift through a look at esspecially for a novice website builder like me. Another problem with this website which aggrevates me is the fact that it is a million miles long. The layout of the page is very displeasing. There isn't really a header or footer. The Menu bar as well is not big or in the center of the page. This could hinder ones ability to navigate through the page. Another problem with this website is the dead space on the right. This dead space makes the website feel lopsided. My last complaint with this website is the lack of connecting background with the title and the information it creates a disconnect and makes the page seem unconnected and not flowing. Overall I am not impressed with Yale. I definitley wouldn't go there because of this unprofessional page. If I had to rate the page out of 10 it would be a 1 out of 10. </p>
