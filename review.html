<h3 px 30>Final Decision! </h3>

<p>If I were to choose one of these companies to use when creating my website I would have to choose... Sitebuilder.com.
I chose Sitebuilder.com because, at this point in my life, my website creation skills are poor. It helps that with a few
questions they will build your website for you. I feel that all of their services and their homepage are very user friendly
as well. Their only downside is their price but I do suppose I am paying for the ease of creating a website.  </p>
